# crypto-price-nodejs-app

This is a simple application which uses coinmarketAPI to fetch the latest price of any token.


It is as simple as clone the repo, import it on heroku and deploy

just made sure to add the API key in the settings 

you fetch a JSON response when called with "https://your-heroku-url.com/api/token/:tokenID" 
replace `tokenID` with any token symbol and you get the response.
